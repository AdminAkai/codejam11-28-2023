# Nov 28, 2023 Code Jam Challenges

## New Years Resolution Tracker 🎉
Create a class to track progress towards New Year's goals. Each goal should have a name and a target number (like hours to study, books to read). Include methods to add goals, log progress, and check if goals are met. Optionally, create a UI for users to leverage these methods.

## Secret Santa Generator 🎅
Develop a Secret Santa generator that accepts an array of names. Each person is assigned another person to give a gift to, ensuring no one gets themselves and there are no duplicate assignments. The function should return a mapping of each person to their assigned giftee. For additional complexity, account for optional exclusions (Bob can't be trusted to give a gift to Linda, etc.)

## Thanksgiving Meal Simulator 🍗
Simulate the preparation of a Thanksgiving meal using asynchronous JavaScript. Create a set of functions representing different dishes being prepared. Each function should return a promise that resolves after a certain amount of time, simulating the cooking time. Include a function to coordinate the meal preparation, ensuring that some dishes start only after certain others are completed and that all dishes are ready at approximately the same time. For complexity, account for a limited amount of ovens and/or burners for cooking.

## Holiday Volunteer Schedule Optimizer 📋
Create a function to optimally schedule volunteers for a holiday charity event. The function should take an array of volunteers, each with their available time slots, and the total number of time slots for the event. The goal is to assign volunteers to time slots, ensuring each slot has at least one volunteer and the distribution is as even as possible. Optionally, create a UI to add volunteers and their availability, then display the schedule.
