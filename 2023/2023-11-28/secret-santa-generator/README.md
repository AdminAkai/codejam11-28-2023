## Secret Santa Generator ðŸŽ…
Develop a Secret Santa generator that accepts an array of names. Each person is assigned another person to give a gift to, ensuring no one gets themselves and there are no duplicate assignments. The function should return a mapping of each person to their assigned giftee. For additional complexity, account for optional exclusions (Bob can't be trusted to give a gift to Linda, etc.)
